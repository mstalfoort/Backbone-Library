Enter Django JavaScript Integration: AJAX and jQuery _ your comprehensive answer to all these questions and the only extensive, practical, and hands-on guide to developing any AJAX application with Django and jQuery.Gone are the days when you used to lament over the lack of official documentation on AJAX with Django. This book will teach you exactly why Django is called \"The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines\", how jQuery _ the \"write less do more\" JavaScript library _ is practically a virtual higher-level language, and why they both deserve to be integrated with AJAX.This hands-on-guide shows you how to put Django and jQuery together in the process of creating an AJAX application. In this book, they are brought together in a real-world scenario, with attention to usability, to build and develop an AJAX application.The first two chapters provide a short and necessary introduction to the world of Django, jQuery, and AJAX; and the remaining chapters are based on a case study that will make you realize the immense potential and benefits of integrating Django and jQuery with your AJAX application.By the time you are done with this book, you''ll be developing your AJAX applications with Django and jQuery in less time than you can say \"integrate\".You will cover the basics of AJAX; use jQuery, the commonest JavaScript library, on the client side, and learn form validation with an eye to usability, build things with Django on the server-side, handle login and authentication via Django-based AJAX, and then dip into the rich jQuery plugin ecosystem to build in-place editing into your pages. You will add auto-complete functionality courtesy of jQuery UI, easily build forms with Django ModelForm, and then look at a client-side search implementation that can look things up without network access after initial download. You will learn to Implement a simple, expandable undo system, and offer more full-blooded account management, tinker, fix some bugs, offer a more usable way to handle password input, add local time support for people who are not in your time zone, look at usability, and finally take a look at debugging.After working through this book, you will have both an AJAX application and a deep understanding that you can use to customize, extend, and further develop it in your organization.This book has been written and tested for Django v 1.2.3 and jQuery v 1.4.4.',324,'Packt Publishing','2011-01-06','9781849510349','Paperback',0.00,'Jonathan Hayward','http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search?keywords=9781849510349+Jonathan+Hayward+Django+JavaScript+Integration&tag=collectorzapp-21&index=books'),

Drupal 6 is loaded with new features, and not all of them are necessarily implemented in PHP. This unique book, for web designers and developers, will take you through what can be done with JavaScript (and especially with jQuery) in Drupal 6. With the combination of the powerhouse jQuery library with its own robust set of JavaScript tools, Drupal 6 comes with a pre-packaged killer JavaScript environment. Cross-platform by nature, it provides all of the tools necessary to create powerful AJAX-enabled scripts, gorgeous visual effects, and view-enhancing behaviors. In addition, Drupal developers have ported some of its most powerful PHP tools - like a theming engine and support for localization and language translation - to JavaScript, making it possible to write simple scripts where once only complex PHP code could be used. This book gives you the keys to the toolbox, showing you how to use Drupal''s JavaScript libraries to make your modules and themes more dynamic, interactive and responsive, and add effects to make your Drupal site explode into life! If you''ve dipped your toe in the water of theme or module development with Drupal 6, this is the book you want to make the look and behavior of your work something special. With it''s project-based approach, this book is carefully constructed to guide you from how JavaScript fits into the overall Drupal architecture through to making you a master of the jQuery library in the world of Drupal themes and modules. What you will learn from this book? An introduction to JavaScript in Drupal 6The basics of the jQuery libraryCreating JavaScript-enabled themes Manipulating a page on the fly with jQueryAuthoring simple PHPTemplate files designed to maximize scripting potentialUsing jQuery to add effects in Drupal 6Working with Drupal 6 behaviors Adding AJAX to modulesUsing Drupal''s localization and language translation engine in your JavaScript Theming on the client-side with Drupal''s JavaScript theme engine Building better forms Working with Drupal 6''s JavaScript libraryWriting portable JavaScript tools as Drupal modules Approach This book focuses on teaching by example. Chapters are packed with example code, providing hands-on examples you can play with and then release to your own Drupal sites. By introducing short projects interspersed with discussion, the pace is rapid yet practical. Who this book is written for? This book is for web designers and developers who want to add JavaScript elements to Drupal themes or modules to create more flexible and responsive user interfaces. You are expected to know about the basic operation of Drupal, and be familiar with the concept of theming and modules in Drupal. No experience of creating themes or modules is required. You will need to know the basics of client-side web development; this means HTML, CSS, but also have a rudimentary grasp of the syntax of JavaScript. Familiarity with PHP programming will be an advantage, since we will be writing PHPTemplate files and (at the end) creating Drupal modules. However, the PHP is covered thoroughly enough that even the PHP neophyte will not find the text too demanding. The book also covers the jQuery JavaScript library and its use in Drupal, but no knowledge of jQuery is expected - you will learn everything you need in this book.',340,'Packt Publishing','2009-02-27','9781847196163','Paperback',24.99,'Matt Butcher','http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1847196160?tag=collectorzapp-21'),

And while there are dozens of \"how- to\" JavaScript books available, few literally hand the Webmaster a set of ready-to-go, client-side JavaScript applications with thorough documentation that enable the reader to fully understand and extend those applications. By providing such a set of applications, \"JavaScript Application Cookbook\" allows Webmasters to immediately add extra functionality to their Web sites.  This book targets readers with two different skill sets. The primary target is JavaScript-knowledgeable Webmasters and designers who can immediately begin constructing their own versions of the applications. The secondary target is those with little or no JavaScript experience. The included applications are ready for immediate use and require little customization.  This book explores both the code and the techniques that are centered around core JavaScript functionality, a functionality that will not become incompatible or obsolete. The source file design of most applications and libraries will help modularize reader Web sites and facilitate easier site management and coding practices.  Chapters are organized by application. Among the included applications are:  A client-side search engine that will show coders how to build their own search engine and get excellent results, all with a client-side tool A drag-and-drop greeting application that lets users custom build and send DHTML email greetings A GUI image rollover tool that generatescross-browser image rollover code for all versions of JavaScript A robust client-side shopping cart application that lets shoppers browse and shop, while the application keeps a tab of the shopper''s selections and a running bill, including tax and shipping An online test application that auto-administers, grades, and displays answers to online exams or surveys  An additional value to this book is an online resource (http: //www.serve.com/hotsyte/) that discusses the applications and points to other resources.

  (76,'JavaScript: The Good Parts','Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that''s more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you''ll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you''ll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highlyexpressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you''re managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

And rightly so. Where in the past we used to have the occasional few lines of JavaScript embedded in a web page, now we have advanced libraries and extensible architectures, powering the \"fat-client\", AJAX-type rich internet applications.  JavaScript is the language of the browser, but it''s also heavily employed in many other environments: server-side programming, desktop applications, application extensions and widgets. It''s a pretty good deal: you learn one language and then code all kinds of different applications. While this book has one chapter specifically dedicated to the web browser environment including DOM, events, and AJAX tutorials, the rest is applicable to all the other environments too.  This book treats JavaScript as a serious object-oriented language, showing you how to build robust, maintainable, and powerful libraries and applications. Along the way, we cover many of the recent innovations such as AJAX, JSON, and interesting design and coding patterns. After reading this book, you''ll be prepared to ace your JavaScript job interview and even impress with some bits that the interviewer maybe didn''t know. You should read this book if you want to be able to take your JavaScript skills to a new level of sophistication.  What you will learn from this book?  * Learn to think in JavaScript, the language of the web browser * The basics of object-oriented programming, and how they apply to JavaScript * Set up and use your training environment (Firebug) * Master data types, operators, and flow control statements * Understand functions: usage patterns, variable scope, and built-in functions * Closures demystified * Create and use objects * Understand and use prototypes * Reuse code with common patterns for inheritance * Understand and work with the BOM (Browser Object Model) * The DOM (Document Object Model) - accessing, modifying, adding, and deleting nodes * Build responsive web pages with AJAX * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) * Listen and respond to browser events * Apply design patterns to solve common problems * Adopt coding patterns that unleash the unique power of the language * Make your programs cleaner, faster, and compatible with other programs and libraries * Achieve missing object-oriented features in JavaScript such as private properties and methods  Who is this book written for?  The book requires no prior knowledge of JavaScript and works from the ground up to give you a thorough grounding in this powerful language. If you do already know some JavaScript, you will find plenty of eye-openers as you discover just what the language can do.  This book takes a do-it-yourself approach when it comes to writing code, because the best way to really learn a programming language is by writing code. You are encouraged to type code into Firebug''s console, see how it works and then tweak it and play around with it.

In contrast, Peter-Paul Koch''s book uses eight real-world scripts he created for real-world clients in order to earn real-world money. That means the scripts are guaranteed to do something useful (and sellable!) that enhances the usability of the page they''re used on. The book''s example scripts include one that sorts a data table according to the user''s search queries, a form validation script, a script that shows form fields only when the user needs them, a drop-down menu, and a data retrieval script that uses simple Ajax and shows the data in an animation.

  (99,'Pragmatic Guide to JavaScript','The JavaScript ecosystem can be tough to hack through, even for experienced programmers. There are so many extensive JavaScript reference books and competing libraries to choose from-Prototype, jQuery, MooTools, YUI, Dojo, ExtJS, and so on. Christophe Porteneuve is here to help: he gives you fundamentals, the most handy techniques, and the insider''s best practices. If you''re reasonably comfortable programming in any widely known language, you''ll be able to jump into JavaScript in no time. Divided into six Parts, the book starts with JavaScript code patterns that are too often ignored by JavaScript coders. Part 2 presents several essential JavaScript tasks-DOM and CSS manipulations, plus event handling and timers-in a framework-agnostic way, using syntax from all the major flavors. Parts 3 and 4, respectively, hit JavaScript''s best features for user interface functionality-tooltips, lightboxes, image processing, infinite scrolling, and more-and forms for receiving and validating input. Part 5 explores the client/server relationship, touching on cookies, JSON, and Ajax (same- and cross-domain). Part 6 uses JavaScript in mashups with Twitter, Flickr, and geo-related APIs. The appendices feature Christophe''s two-page JavaScript cheat sheet, followed by hard-won tips on debugging even the most maddening JavaScript errors. Next is an even-handed assessment of the major frameworks used in the book and in most JavaScript shops today. Last, Christophe presents an extensive group of resources for using and learning JavaScript and the major frameworks. This Pragmatic Guide is strictly focused on the techniques that will get you started in JavaScript. It''s where you come to get the full scope of JavaScript in your head--fast!

While similar books focus on either JavaScript as a language of the browser or how to use JavaScript Frameworks, Pro JavaScript with MooTools fills the gap between these topics and moves beyond, exploring the advanced features of JavaScript and how the MooTools framework uses these features to further improve the language itself. The book itself takes a unique three-pronged approach. It first walks you through the advanced features of JavaScript and the MooTools framework, including native augmentation and type creation, a comprehensive discussion of JavaScript functions, Object-Oriented programming with native JavaScript and MooTools Classes, and the MooTools Class internals. You''ll then learn all about Javascript in the DOM: the Elements classes and its internals, the MooTools Event system, Selector engines and MooTools Slick, Ajax and the Request Object, and Animation and the Fx classes. The final section really sets the book apart from all others, as it discusses JavaScript outside the browsers. You''ll take an in-depth look at CommonJS and MooTools, using MooTools outside the browser to build ORM, creating simple CommonJS applications via the MooTools Deck framework, and creating complex Server-Side applications using Raccoon. What you''ll learn How MooTools augments natives and creates new types via the Type constructor and how it uses the advanced features of JavaScript functions to extend the language. All about Object-Oriented programming in native JavaScript and MooTools Class counterpart the internals of the Class Type and other special object-oriented features that the framework adds to the language. How MooTools improves the DOM API via Element and the Events Types; and how Slick, the MooTools selector engine, uses advanced JavaScript features to create a fast and easy way to control the DOM. How MooTools wraps the native XMLHttpRequest to create a truly cross-browser implementation and how the MooTools Fx classes create smooth, powerful animations for the browser.

  (125,'Understanding AJAX: Using JavaScript to Create Rich Internet Applications (Prentice Hall Open Source Software Development Series)','AJAX is hot, hot, hot! Why? It''s simple. With AJAX, internet developers and designers can create web-based applications that look and feel like desktop applications. These are responsive, highly-interactive applications that represent a new breed called \"Rich Internet Applications\" (RIA). This book is a guide to designing, implementing, and debugging AJAX applications. The book begins by comparing and contrasting the traditional web application lifecycle with that of an AJAX application. It then covers core AJAX technology, including the XMLHTTPRequest object, and describes various methods for \"consuming\" data returned by it. Because AJAX represents a fundamentally new way of creating web applications, the book is careful to explore usability guidelines for AJAX developers. This is followed by a series of use cases that show how specific problems are solved in both the pre-AJAX and post-AJAX worlds. The book ends with a chapter on debugging AJAX applications, along with appendices that cover toolkits that greatly simplify AJAX development. All of the server-side examples presented in the book will be written in PHP, the most popular langauage for server-side web programming.',352,'Prentice Hall','2006-08-21','978-0-13-221635-7','Paperback',39.99,'Joshua Eichorn','http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132216353?tag=collectorzapp-20'),
