Backbone-Library is a simple client-side MVC CRUD application to demonstrate the power
of combining several JavaScript libraries:
- Backbone (Underscore)
- jQuery
- RequireJS

To properly setup the RESTful API, follow these steps:
- create a database named "library"
- execute data/library.sql
- change db settings in api/config.inc.php
- add api/.htaccess file with following contents:

RewriteEngine On

# Some hosts may require you to use the `RewriteBase` directive.
# If you need to use the `RewriteBase` directive, it should be the
# absolute physical path to the directory that contains this htaccess file.
#
# RewriteBase /

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
